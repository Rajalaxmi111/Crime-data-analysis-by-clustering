# Crime-data-analysis-by-clustering
The dataset has large number of numerical columns which was the main reason for choosing such a dataset rather than a categorical one because it makes is easy to apply algorithms and avoids the hassle of conversion of categorical data to numerical data. The crime attributes in the dataset that could be predicted by applying various machine learning algorithms as considered by the FBI are Rape, Murder, Larceny, Robbery, Assault, Burglaries, Autotheft and Arsons.The other columns in the dataset include information about community names, county codes, community codes, percent of the population considered urban, age based population, gender based population, race based population and so on which are useful factors to predict crimes. We used some features as predictors from the dataset to train the different models and created a binary label to predict the Occurence of Crime based on the selected features.
